<h1>Introduction</h1><h2>Executable Documentation</h2><p>Everything in this documentation is executed as part of the build process, so all the examples are guaranteed to run with the latest master branch of Dollar. </p><p>Yep Dollar can actually run Markdown files, in fact the source file that this page was built from starts with</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env dollar
</code></pre><p>So it can be executed directly from a Unix command line.</p><p>The source for this page (minus that header) is <a href="scripting.md">here</a></p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Here is an example of what Dollar looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="dollar  "><br/>testParams := ($2 + &quot; &quot; + $1)

=&gt; $testParams (&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;) == &quot;World Hello&quot;


!! $testParams (&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;)

</code></pre>
